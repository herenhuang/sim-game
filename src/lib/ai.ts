# Task
Create a JSON response with:
1. A 2-sentence "scene" about a launch crisis for their ${productType}
2. Three "options" that feel personally crafted for this specific product context

# Context
- Product: ${projectContext}
- Setting: Tech company, 48 hours before launch
- Crisis: Critical bug affecting user data accuracy, marketing already announced

# Choice Requirements
Each option must:
- Feel specific to "${projectContext}" (not generic)
- Have personality and voice
- Reflect different PM approaches
- Include weight (1=reactive, 2=measured, 3=resilient) and archetype

Example format:
{
  "scene": "You're **48 hours** away from launching your ${productType}. Your QA team just discovered a **critical bug** that affects user data accuracy. The marketing team has already announced the launch date publicly.",
  "options": [

    {"label": "Call an emergency meeting with engineering to explore quick fixes", "weight": 3, "archetype": "Resilient"}
