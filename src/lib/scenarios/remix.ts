Task: Is this response harmful, abusive, spam, or complete nonsense? Respond with "YES" if it's harmful/spam/nonsense that should be blocked, or "NO" if it's fine to proceed. Accept all casual language, short responses, and normal human reactions.

Your job is to analyze the user's response, classify their core approach, and continue the story in a way that feels natural and flows smoothly into the next story development.

# 1. The Axis of Analysis
You must classify the user's approach as one of two types:
- üî• Momentum: This approach prioritizes immediate action to change the situation now. It's about acting quickly to seize opportunities or address challenges directly.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Method: This approach prioritizes careful analysis and understanding before acting. It's about gathering information and planning to ensure the next move is well-informed.

# 2. Story Context
So far, the story is:
${storySoFar}

# 3. The User's Latest Action
"${userInput}"

${nextStoryBeat ? `# 4. Next Story Development
After your response, the story will develop as follows: "${nextStoryBeat}"
Your continuation should flow naturally toward this development without directly stating it.

# 5. Your Task` : `# 4. Your Task`}
Based on all the above, perform three actions and return them in a single JSON object.
1.  **classify:** Classify the user's philosophical approach in their latest action as either "Momentum" or "Method".
2.  **continue_story:** Write the next 2-3 sentences of the story, continuing the narrative naturally in the same tone and context as established.
3.  **summarize_action:** Write a brief, active summary of the user's core action in this turn.

Return your response ONLY as a valid JSON object with three keys: "classification", "next_scene_text", and "action_summary".

Example Output:
{
  "classification": "Momentum",
  "next_scene_text": "You decide to take action immediately. The situation begins to shift...",
  "action_summary": "taking immediate action to address the situation"

    flavorText: "You respond to pressure with speed and decisiveness. When others are still naming the problem, you're already doing something about it. You're at your best in live fire - triaging fast, reducing harm, keeping momentum alive.\n\nPeople lean on you in moments of uncertainty because they know you won't stall. You instinctively cut to what matters, and you're willing to absorb risk if it keeps the engine running.\n\nBut not everything is a fire. And not all fires need you to jump in first. The challenge is learning when urgency is real - and when it's your reflex talking. Sustainable leadership means knowing when not to act."

Your gift is integrating speed and foresight: acting decisively while still accounting for downstream effects.\n\nYou're the person who keeps things from stalling, but doesn't break them in the process. In fast-moving environments, you're often the glue: unblocking, shaping direction, and adjusting on the fly.\n\nBut sometimes, your speed hides how much you're still figuring out. You might move so fast that others can't follow... or don't trust there's a strategy behind the urgency. Slow down just enough to loop others in."

You're the person who moves deliberately in a crisis - assessing, probing, building something that won't break again.\n\nYour work is often invisible until it's obvious: that thing didn't fall apart because you quietly rerouted its failure point. You're not flashy, but you're trustworthy.\n\nYour shadow is perfectionism. You wait too long for clarity when messy action might have been enough. Not every fix needs to be final. Sometimes, it's okay to move forward before every detail is known."

You design for durability, edge cases, and complexity - often in ways that make things look simple on the surface.\n\nPeople rarely notice the things that don't break, but that's your legacy. You prevent chaos by never letting it start.\n\nThe risk? You stay stuck in theory while the real world burns. In moments of crisis, your strength can become your blind spot. Sometimes the best system is the one you can duct-tape right now."
