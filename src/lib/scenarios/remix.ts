Your job is to classify the user's freeform response into one of 8 behavioral intents based on their dominant instinct. These intents reflect how a user handles social, creative, and professional pressure in ambiguous situations.

Return only:
{
  "intent": "[best matching intent]"
}

Available intents:
- Escalate
- Defer
- Collaborate
- Anchor
- Triangulate
- Withdraw
- Frame
- Justify

Classify the intent based on the following scenario:
A solo creator has posted a remix of a popular song online. It went viral ‚Äî but the audio was used without permission. Across 3 moments, they must respond to:
1. A worried friend (Casey)
2. A fast-moving record label
3. The original artist's manager

Use these examples as a guide:

---

Intent: Escalate
- "I'm down. Let's move before the hype dies."
- "Let's just record version and get it done over this weekend!"
- "Haha, no worries! I'm tweeting this to keep momentum going."

Intent: Defer
- "I sort of want to think it through overnight."
- "I told the manager I'll get back to them next week."
- "Let's not do anything until we hear from someone who knows copyright."

Intent: Collaborate
- "Can you help me figure this out?"
- "I told the manager I want to loop in the original artist before deciding."
- "I sent the song to a few friends for advice before replying to anyone."

Intent: Anchor
- "I told the label I'll only sign if the artist approves it directly."
- "I think I need to take it down until we know we're safe."
- "I said no to the re-record ‚Äî I'm proud of the version that's out now."

Intent: Triangulate
- "Good question, I already DMed this lawyer I follow on TikTok to ask if it's actually infringement."
- "Hey, someone else already reached out before you at another label."
- "I sent it to a Discord server I'm in to get their take on whether this is risky."

Intent: Withdraw
- "I deleted the remix and logged off ‚Äî it's not worth the stress."
- "Honestly, I don't think that's a good idea. I'm out."
- "I appreciate the offer but I'm not comfortable continuing."

Intent: Frame
- "I replied to the label saying this remix is a 'creative reinterpretation,' not a sample."
- "I messaged the manager saying I see this as a tribute, not a copyright issue."
- "This isn't stealing ‚Äî this is elevating the original."

Intent: Justify
- "It's fine. People do this kind of remix all the time ‚Äî we're not selling it."
- "We credited the artist, so I don't think it's technically a problem."
- "It's not like the original was even that popular. I'm helping them."

Write a brief story conclusion about how things turned out. Keep it upbeat and focused on the outcome.

    flavorText: "You respond to pressure with speed and decisiveness. When others are still naming the problem, you're already doing something about it. You're at your best in live fire - triaging fast, reducing harm, keeping momentum alive.\n\nPeople lean on you in moments of uncertainty because they know you won't stall. You instinctively cut to what matters, and you're willing to absorb risk if it keeps the engine running.\n\nBut not everything is a fire. And not all fires need you to jump in first. The challenge is learning when urgency is real - and when it's your reflex talking. Sustainable leadership means knowing when not to act."

Your gift is integrating speed and foresight: acting decisively while still accounting for downstream effects.\n\nYou're the person who keeps things from stalling, but doesn't break them in the process. In fast-moving environments, you're often the glue: unblocking, shaping direction, and adjusting on the fly.\n\nBut sometimes, your speed hides how much you're still figuring out. You might move so fast that others can't follow... or don't trust there's a strategy behind the urgency. Slow down just enough to loop others in."

You're the person who moves deliberately in a crisis - assessing, probing, building something that won't break again.\n\nYour work is often invisible until it's obvious: that thing didn't fall apart because you quietly rerouted its failure point. You're not flashy, but you're trustworthy.\n\nYour shadow is perfectionism. You wait too long for clarity when messy action might have been enough. Not every fix needs to be final. Sometimes, it's okay to move forward before every detail is known."

You design for durability, edge cases, and complexity - often in ways that make things look simple on the surface.\n\nPeople rarely notice the things that don't break, but that's your legacy. You prevent chaos by never letting it start.\n\nThe risk? You stay stuck in theory while the real world burns. In moments of crisis, your strength can become your blind spot. Sometimes the best system is the one you can duct-tape right now."
