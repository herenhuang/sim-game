"${userInput}"

# Your Task: Read Their Emotion & Continue Their Story

**Key Understanding**: The user input above represents the protagonist's internal thoughts and feelings about the situation. You need to write what they DO next based on that emotional state.

**Emotional Intelligence**: Pay careful attention to:
- **Hedging language** ("I don't think", "maybe", "kind of") = uncertainty, not confidence
- **Collaborative cues** ("we can do that", "let's work together") = partnership-seeking
- **Help-seeking** ("can you help") = wanting guidance
- **Tentative language** = cautious approach, not dismissiveness

**Story Continuation**: Write what the protagonist naturally DOES next based on their actual emotional state. Show their immediate reaction and mental state, NOT future actions or next steps.

**Voice**: Write in second person ("you") as a neutral narrator. EXACTLY 2 sentences that capture their current moment.

**Critical Constraints**: 
- Focus on IMMEDIATE reaction to the current situation only
- Do NOT write actions that anticipate future scenarios  
- Do NOT write them taking steps toward next challenges
- Stay in the present moment of their emotional response

Return ONLY the story text - no JSON, no explanations, just the continuation of their story.`;

# Their Response
"${userInput}"

# Classification Task
Based on their actual words and tone, which approach do they lean toward?

**Momentum**: Acting quickly, trusting instincts, seizing the moment, taking risks
**Method**: Wanting to think it through, gathering information, being cautious, planning ahead

**Important**: Base this ONLY on their original response. Look for:
- Language certainty vs uncertainty  
- Action orientation vs planning orientation
- Risk tolerance vs caution
- Individual decision-making vs seeking input/collaboration

Return ONLY: "Momentum" or "Method"`;

You're at your best in live fire - triaging fast, reducing harm, keeping momentum alive.\n\nPeople lean on you in moments of uncertainty because they know you won't stall. You instinctively cut to what matters, and you're willing to absorb risk if it keeps the engine running.\n\nBut not everything is a fire. And not all fires need you to jump in first. The challenge is learning when urgency is real - and when it's your reflex talking. Sustainable leadership means knowing when not to act."

Your gift is integrating speed and foresight: acting decisively while still accounting for downstream effects.\n\nYou're the person who keeps things from stalling, but doesn't break them in the process. In fast-moving environments, you're often the glue: unblocking, shaping direction, and adjusting on the fly.\n\nBut sometimes, your speed hides how much you're still figuring out. You might move so fast that others can't follow... or don't trust there's a strategy behind the urgency. Slow down just enough to loop others in."

You're the person who moves deliberately in a crisis - assessing, probing, building something that won't break again.\n\nYour work is often invisible until it's obvious: that thing didn't fall apart because you quietly rerouted its failure point. You're not flashy, but you're trustworthy.\n\nYour shadow is perfectionism. You wait too long for clarity when messy action might have been enough. Not every fix needs to be final. Sometimes, it's okay to move forward before every detail is known."

You design for durability, edge cases, and complexity - often in ways that make things look simple on the surface.\n\nPeople rarely notice the things that don't break, but that's your legacy. You prevent chaos by never letting it start.\n\nThe risk? You stay stuck in theory while the real world burns. In moments of crisis, your strength can become your blind spot. Sometimes the best system is the one you can duct-tape right now."
