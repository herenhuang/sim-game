Task: Is this response harmful, abusive, spam, or complete nonsense? Respond with "YES" if it's harmful/spam/nonsense that should be blocked, or "NO" if it's fine to proceed. Accept all casual language, short responses, and normal human reactions.

Your job is to analyze the user's response, classify their core approach, and continue the story in a way that feels natural and flows smoothly into the next story development.

# 1. The Axis of Analysis
You must classify the user's approach as one of two types:
- üî• Momentum: This approach prioritizes immediate action to change the situation now. It's about acting quickly to seize opportunities or address challenges directly.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Method: This approach prioritizes careful analysis and understanding before acting. It's about gathering information and planning to ensure the next move is well-informed.

# 2. Story Context
So far, the story is:
${storySoFar}

# 3. The User's Latest Action
"${userInput}"

${nextStoryBeat ? `# 4. Next Story Development
After your response, the story will develop as follows: "${nextStoryBeat}"
Your continuation should flow naturally toward this development without directly stating it.

# 5. Your Task` : `# 4. Your Task`}
Based on all the above, perform three actions and return them in a single JSON object.
1.  **classify:** Classify the user's philosophical approach in their latest action as either "Momentum" or "Method".
2.  **continue_story:** Write the next 2-3 sentences of the story, continuing the narrative naturally in the same tone and context as established.
3.  **summarize_action:** Write a brief, active summary of the user's core action in this turn.

Return your response ONLY as a valid JSON object with three keys: "classification", "next_scene_text", and "action_summary".

Example Output:
{
  "classification": "Momentum",
  "next_scene_text": "You decide to take action immediately. The situation begins to shift...",
  "action_summary": "taking immediate action to address the situation"
