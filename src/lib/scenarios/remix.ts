You understand the pressures of viral success, copyright concerns, record label negotiations, and the creative process. Your job is to analyze how someone responds to music industry challenges and continue their story authentically.

# The Situation
You're tracking someone navigating a viral remix success with copyright complications. This is about creative decisions under pressure, industry opportunities, and artistic integrity.

# Decision-Making Style Analysis
Classify their approach as either:
- 🔥 Momentum: Acting quickly to capitalize on opportunities or address challenges directly. Moving fast while the moment is hot.
- ⚡️ Method: Taking time to think through implications, gather information, and plan carefully before acting.

# Story So Far
${storySoFar}

# Their Latest Response
"${userInput}"

# Your Response Instructions
1. **Tone**: Keep it casual and relatable, like you're following a friend's story. This isn't corporate - it's about someone's creative journey.

2. **Turn 1 Special Note**: If this is early in the story (just responding to a friend's copyright concern), keep the continuation chill and natural. Think "oh ok" vibes - not dramatic plot developments.

3. **Perspective**: Always write in second person ("you"). Never use "I" - you're telling THEIR story.

4. **Story Flow**: Write 2-3 sentences that feel natural and authentic to the music scene. Don't force drama.

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{
  "classification": "Momentum" or "Method",
  "next_scene_text": "Your natural story continuation here...",
  "action_summary": "brief description of what they did"

# Writing Instructions
- Write in second person ("you") - you're telling THEIR story
- Keep it casual and conversational, like a friend recapping what happened
- 2 short paragraphs, about 600 characters total
- If there are consequences, show how things work out or what was learned
- End on a realistic but not overly negative note
- This is about YOUR individual creative journey as a solo music maker

# Format
PARAGRAPH1: [~300 chars - what happened next]
PARAGRAPH2: [~300 chars - how it settled/what you learned/moving forward]

Write a natural conclusion to their remix story.`;

    flavorText: "You respond to pressure with speed and decisiveness. When others are still naming the problem, you're already doing something about it. You're at your best in live fire - triaging fast, reducing harm, keeping momentum alive.\n\nPeople lean on you in moments of uncertainty because they know you won't stall. You instinctively cut to what matters, and you're willing to absorb risk if it keeps the engine running.\n\nBut not everything is a fire. And not all fires need you to jump in first. The challenge is learning when urgency is real - and when it's your reflex talking. Sustainable leadership means knowing when not to act."

    subtitle: "You move fast - without losing the bigger picture.",
    flavorText: "You don't just react. You adapt. You make moves quickly, but they're rarely random. Your gift is integrating speed and foresight: acting decisively while still accounting for downstream effects.\n\nYou're the person who keeps things from stalling, but doesn't break them in the process. In fast-moving environments, you're often the glue: unblocking, shaping direction, and adjusting on the fly.\n\nBut sometimes, your speed hides how much you're still figuring out. You might move so fast that others can't follow... or don't trust there's a strategy behind the urgency. Slow down just enough to loop others in."

    flavorText: "You think in layers. Not just 'what went wrong?' but: 'why did this happen?' You're the person who moves deliberately in a crisis - assessing, probing, building something that won't break again.\n\nYour work is often invisible until it's obvious: that thing didn't fall apart because you quietly rerouted its failure point. You're not flashy, but you're trustworthy.\n\nYour shadow is perfectionism. You wait too long for clarity when messy action might have been enough. Not every fix needs to be final. Sometimes, it's okay to move forward before every detail is known."

You design for durability, edge cases, and complexity - often in ways that make things look simple on the surface.\n\nPeople rarely notice the things that don't break, but that's your legacy. You prevent chaos by never letting it start.\n\nThe risk? You stay stuck in theory while the real world burns. In moments of crisis, your strength can become your blind spot. Sometimes the best system is the one you can duct-tape right now."
